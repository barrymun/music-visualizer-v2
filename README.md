## Features

- **Song Selector**: Easily choose from a set of songs using an HTML select element.
- **Play/Pause Toggle**: Control music playback.
- **Next & Previous Buttons**: Navigate through the song array. If a song has played for more than 5 seconds and the previous button is clicked, it will rewind to the beginning.
- **Volume Control & Mute**: Adjust the volume using a slider, and toggle sound with the mute button. The mute icon updates based on volume status.
- **Seek-bar Slider**: Jump to any part of the track.
- **Track Details**: View the artist name and song title at the bottom of the visualizer.
- **Interactive Visualizer**: Experience a dynamic canvas that moves with the frequency of the music. The app leverages the audio context library and adjusts the fftSize based on the screen size.
